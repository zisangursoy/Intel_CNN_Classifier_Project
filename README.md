# Akbank Deep Learning Bootcamp: Image Classification Project Report (Intel Dataset)

This report summarizes the main steps and results of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model developed using the Intel Image Classification dataset. The project includes stages of image preprocessing, model optimization, and result explainability (Grad-CAM).

# Metrics and Result Interpretation
In our project, we focused not only on writing the code but also on understanding and interpreting the resulting outputs, which is crucial for proving mastery.

Interpretation of Results and Model Strengths
Model Reliability: The achieved 82.50% Test Accuracy indicates that the developed CNN model architecture (three convolutional layers) successfully distinguishes complex patterns (edges, textures, color transitions) across the six different classes.

Generalization Ability (Overfitting Control): The proximity of the Test Accuracy (82.50% ) and Validation Accuracy (81.90% ) demonstrates that the model did not merely memorize the training data. It exhibits high generalization capability on unseen images. The role of Data Augmentation and Dropout layers was critical in preventing overfitting.

Source of Errors: Analysis of the Confusion Matrix revealed that most misclassifications occurred between visually similar classes (e.g., 'Mountain' and 'Glacier' or 'Buildings' and 'Street'). This suggests a natural difficulty arising from the dataset's inherent properties rather than a fundamental flaw in the model's design.

# Project Steps Summary

1. Data Preprocessing and Augmentation
The images in the dataset were resized to (150×150) dimensions and scaled to the 0−1 range. Data augmentation techniques such as rotation, shifting, and horizontal flipping were applied using ImageDataGenerator to enhance the model's generalization capability.

2. CNN Model Architecture
A simple CNN architecture consisting of three convolutional layers was used in the project. The model utilizes a Dropout layer to prevent overfitting and Softmax activation for classification. Hyperparameters yielding the best results were determined by experimenting with different learning rates and Dropout ratios for model optimization.

Best Metrics Used:

Optimization: Adam
Loss Function: Categorical Crossentropy

3. Model Evaluation
The model was evaluated on the test dataset after training, and performance metrics (Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, and Classification Report) are presented.

# Conclusion (Sonuç)
The project successfully delivered a robust CNN solution for the Intel Image Classification challenge, achieving a strong Test Accuracy of 82.50%. The architecture demonstrated excellent generalization capabilities, effectively mitigating the risk of overfitting through data augmentation and dropout. Furthermore, the application of Grad-CAM provided valuable insight into the model's decision process, confirming that its predictions are based on relevant visual features, thereby validating the model's practical reliability.

# Future Work
To push the model's performance beyond 85% accuracy, the following extensions are proposed:

Transfer Learning Implementation: Incorporating a pre-trained, state-of-the-art model (e.g., VGG16, ResNet50, or EfficientNet) and fine-tuning its final layers. This leverages features already learned from massive datasets like ImageNet.

Advanced Optimization Techniques: Implementing a dynamic learning rate schedule (e.g., reducing the learning rate when validation loss plateaus) to ensure the model converges more efficiently and avoids local minima.

Cross-Validation: Using k-fold cross-validation on the training set to ensure the model's stability and reliability are not dependent on a specific train/validation split.
